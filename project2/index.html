    <h2 class="title">Antwerp introduces &lsquo;text walking lanes&rsquo; for pedestrians using mobile phones
    by <span class="author">Anne Droyd-Leuvre</span></h2>
    <p>The Belgian city of Antwerp has come up with a solution to the problem of pedestrians bumping into other people while sending text messages       from their mobile phones. Smartphone users now have their own designated lanes, where they can walk while texting or otherwise using their mobile     devices without irritating or endangering others.</p>

    <p>These lanes are marked &lsquo;text walking lane&rsquo; in English on a number of busy pedestrian shopping streets in the city centre. The markings on the     ground are in highly visible white paint, but some lanes wind through narrow cobbled streets. Negotiating the corners is likely to remain             challenging for people whose eyes are glued to their phone screens.</p>

    <p>The scheme is the brainchild of city councilwoman, Frieda Wander, who says many smartphones are broken in collisions among pedestrians.</p>

    <p><q>Everyone <q>textwalks,</q></q> says Wander. <q>You probably walk through the streets while texting and not paying attention to your surroundings     – only to whomever is chatting on your screen. This causes collisions with other pedestrians. You could, unknowingly, even walk right into your       text mate.</q></p>

    <p>If pedestrian lanes are successful, Wander plans next year to propose a similar solution for texting drivers.</p>

    by <span class="author">Susan Sochs</span></h2>
    <p>Draped in a Union Jack flag, Alan <q>Big Piggy</q> Nash retained his title last weekend as World Toe Wrestling Champion. The Derbyshire             village of Boughringtown in northern England hosted the World Championship of Toe Wrestling last weekend in a competition that drew spectators       of all ages for some serious toe-tussling.</p>

    <p>Toe wrestling traces its roots to 1976 when Staffordshire pub landlord George Burgess sought to find a new sport for Brits to dominate,             according to the Bentley Brook Inn where the championship took place.  <q>I just love the fact that this is the one sport that England always         win at, we get hammered at everything else,</q> Nash said. <q>My technique ... is to hurt the first person that comes into the ring with me:         hurt them bad and terrify everyone else.</q></p>

    <p>There are two participants in each bout. With their feet on a small square ring on the floor, the competitors begin by locking their big toes     together, before battling arm-wrestling style to drive their opponent's foot to the ground. Toe inspections are a must and mixed sex matches are,     of course, not allowed.</p>

    <q>There have been some dirty toed tactics, &lsquo;flicking off&rsquo; is one of them,</q> organiser Edward Allington said. <q>If you know you're going to         lose, if you pull your toe away then it's difficult for the referee to decide if it's accidental or deliberate.</q>

    by <span class="author">Ima Hogg</span></h2>
    <p>This spring, Nottingham Trent University is looking to make exam season a little less painful—and a lot more adorable—for its students.</p>

    <p>Members of NTU's student union have decided to create a piglet room for their fellow students to use to de-stress. Students are allowed to         spend a few minutes interacting with the tiny swine, as well as baby goats, chicks, and even a donkey foal.</p>

    <p>This ingenious idea is actually a fundraiser for a local guide dog organization. After the success of a similar puppy event last year, they         decided to branch out.</p>

    <p><q>It’s been busy the entire two days,</q> student union president Igor Beaver explained. <q>There’s just a really good buzz around the         campus.</q> That buzz is spreading to the Internet as well, with the hashtag #PigletRoom taking over Twitter and Instagram.</p>

    <p>Other universities around the United Kingdom have tried this tactic, too. The most popular option seems to be puppies, although Bath Spa             University opted for Shetland ponies. Universities in the United States have followed suit, using everything from chickens to therapy cats in         order to help students stay calm.</p>

    by <span class="author">Borden Drousy</span></h2>
    <p>Eureka! After about a century of research, Swiss scientists have finally cracked the mystery of the holes in Swiss cheese.</p>

    <p>Despite what you may have been told as a child, they are not caused by mice nibbling away inside cheese wheels.  Experts from Agroscope, a         Swiss centre for agricultural research, say the phenomenon -- which marks famous Swiss cheeses such as Emmental and Appenzell -- is caused by         tiny bits of hay present in the milk and not bacteria as previously thought.</p>

    <p>They found that the mystery holes in such cheeses became smaller or disappeared when milk used for cheese-making was extracted using modern         methods.  <q>It's the disappearance of the traditional bucket</q> used during milking that caused the difference, said Agroscope spokesman I.M.       Shirley Wright, adding that bits of hay fell into it and then eventually cause the holes.</p>

by <span class="author">Homer Simpson</span></h2>
    <p>A Fargo man who admitted being drunk while operating a Zamboni during a high school hockey game was convicted Tuesday after the judge rejected his lawyer's argument that the ice-resurfacing machine didn't meet the definition of a vehicle under city code.</p>

    <p>Lewis Cannon, 27, was sentenced to nine days in jail, with credit for one day served, and ordered a $1,500 fine, chemical dependency evaluation, and participation in the state's 24/7 sobriety program.</p>

    <p>He was arrested in January during a girls hockey game after witnesses complained he was driving erratically on the ice between periods and crashing into the boards. Police say his blood-alcohol content was nearly four times the legal limit for driving a motor vehicle.</p>

    <p>Defense attorney Sue Furst said during the bench trial Tuesday that the law is not clear whether a Zamboni is considered a vehicle, or whether it is illegal to drive the machine on the ice while drunk. But Municipal Court Judge Xavier Breath said state law is written to include vehicles <q>such as</q> a Zamboni.</p>

    <p>Afterward, Furst said her research of DUI law found specific vehicles such as tractors, snowmobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, but she found no references to a Zamboni.</p>

    <p>Cannon, who declined to comment after the hearing, apologized to the court and said he has been sober since the incident. <q>I feel I have been going around in circles, now I just want to start the next period of my life,</q> he said.</p>

<p>Burger King said Friday that the Whopper grilled beef burger-scented cologne will be sold only on April 1, and only in Japan. Sounds too good to be true? It's not an April Fools' Day joke, though the company chose the date deliberately.
The limited <q>Flame Grilled</q> fragrance can be purchased at 5,000 yen (about $40), including the burger. There will be only 1,000 of them.</p>

<p>Officer Rich Dahl of Beaver Dam responded to an anonymous complaint about a woman who brought a kangaroo into McDonald's. Dahl said Tuesday the woman had the baby kangaroo wrapped in a blanket and tucked in an infant car seat.</p>

<p>Dahl says when he confronted the woman she explained the kangaroo was a service animal to help her cope with emotional distress and she produced a letter from a doctor.</p>

    <p>The officer says the woman was upset at first, but then agreed to leave the restaurant. Dahl says he doesn't know if a kangaroo would qualify as a service animal under the law, but he says he's glad he didn't have to find out.</p>

    by <span class="author">Homer Simpson</span></h2>
    <p>Along a lonely stretch of highway in Alliance, Nebraska sits a mysterious monument to America's rich history of putting the pedal to the metal: Carhenge. </p>

<p>Paying homage to Stonehenge, Carhenge has been fascinating people since its installation in the '80s. Dreamed up by Jim Reinders as a memorial to his father, Carhenge consists of a circle of cars with a heel stone, slaughter stone, and two station stones within the circle. In fact, it's a near perfect match to its counterpart across a pond, thanks to Reinder's extensive studies of Stonehenge while living in England.</p>

    <p>While it's certainly the centerpiece, the druidic tribute isn't the only strange thing on the property. There's also a <q>Car Art Preserve</q> populated with plenty of art projects created with vehicle bits and pieces, and even a little graveyard dedicated to three foreign cars buried on the grounds. A full vehicle serves as their makeshift gravestone, reading: <q>Here lie three bones of foreign cars. They served our purpose while Detroit slept. Now Detroit is awake and America's great!</q></p>

<q>Stop pooping on bike path,</q> read two new signs along the trail. And no, it’s not a message directed towards pets.

<p>Apparently joggers who poop along the path have been an increasing problem for Hampton over the past two years, the city’s Public Works supervisor Scott McKay told NBC station KWQC.</p>

<p><q>When the individual does it, it does it right in the lane. It’s not on the center line. It’s not off on the grass,</q> he said. </p>

<p>McKay said there's certainty the act is done by a human and not an animal because the culprit adorns it with toilet paper and leaves the same footprints.</p>

<p>So now he's taken matters into his own hands. In case the runners were under the guise that it was okay to use Mother Nature’s open roadways as their personal toilet, they now have a friendly reminder educating them otherwise.</p>

<p>An employee at the Laurel Garden Apartments in Lakewood got to work Sept. 22 to find a recently installed security camera missing from near the office. The camera was valued at more than $1,500.</p>

    <p>The employee turned the security camera's footage over to the Lakewood Police Department. According to the charging documents, the footage showed Mark Fadness Jr. climbing up to the camera around 5 a.am. and using an electric drill to remove it.</p>

<p>Officers stopped Fadness on suspicion of riding a bicycle without a helmet Sept. 26, and he reportedly admitted to stealing multiple security cameras from Laurel Garden.</p>

<p>According to the charging documents, Fadness took officers to his home and handed over two security cameras he said he had stolen from the apartment building. He also reportedly told officers he stole a third camera, but he "just threw it on the side of the road" because he thought it was fake.</p>

    <p>Fadness said he had no reason for taking the cameras and admitted stealing them was a <q>dumbass thing to do,</q> according to the charging documents. </p>

 <p><q>I am incredibly disappointed by people walking around your shopping centre — it annoys me so bad I want to scream,</q> New-Hobby wrote. <blockquote>You should stop people walking slow as people are in a rush for work and this could cause people being late. It is dangerous because if someone bumped into you that person will fall over. Will you ever tell people not to walk so slow? If you do this for me I will be delighted — please do it.</blockquote></p>

<p>The mall administration responded by creating a <q>fast lane</q> and a <q>slow lane</q> in pink on the floor, divided by dotted white lines like a roadway.

<h2 class="title">It takes guts to make beer
    By <span class="author">Agata Burp</span></h2>

    <p>This medical case gives a whole new meaning to the phrase <q>beer gut.</q> A 61-year-old man — with a history of home-brewing — stumbled into a Texas emergency room complaining of dizziness. Nurses ran a Breathalyzer test and found the man's blood alcohol concentration was a whopping 0.37 percent, or almost five times the legal limit for driving in Texas. There was just one hitch: The man said that he hadn't touched a drop of alcohol that day.</p>

    <p><q>He would get drunk out of the blue — on a Sunday morning after being at church, or really, just anytime,</q> says Barabara Cordell, the dean of nursing at Panola College in Carthage, Texas. <q>His wife was so dismayed about it that she even bought a Breathalyzer.</q> Other medical professionals chalked up the man's problem to "closet drinking." But Cordell and Dr. Justin McCarthy, a gastroenterologist in Lubbock, wanted to figure out what was really going on. So the team searched the man's belongings for liquor and then isolated him in a hospital room for 24 hours.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, he ate carbohydrate-rich foods, and the doctors periodically checked his blood for alcohol. At one point, it rose 0.12 percent. Eventually, McCarthy and Cordell pinpointed the culprit: an overabundance of brewer's yeast in his gut.</p>

<p>According to Cordell and McCarthy, the man's intestinal tract was acting like his own internal brewery. The patient had an infection with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cordell says. So when he ate or drank a bunch of starch — a bagel, pasta or even a soda — the yeast fermented the sugars into ethanol, and he would get drunk. Essentially, he was brewing beer in his own gut.</p>

    By <span class="author">O. C. Dee</span></h2>

    <p>File this under curious. 58-year-old oil investor Richard Gibson has a peculiar collection. For the past 36 years, he has been religiously saving all his toenail clippings in a glass jar. At parties, he must be a real fun guy.</p>

    <p>Collecting toenails is a strange hobby, but Richard says that he didn’t exactly plan for it – it sort of happened as a result of his <s>compulsion</s> curiosity, and he just never stopped. He happened to be clipping his nails one day in February, 1978, and instead of throwing them out, he just put them in a manicure box. He then started doing it repeatedly, just to see how long it would take to fill up the box. That didn’t take too long – only two years – and by then he was pretty much hooked. So he moved his collection to a large glass jar, which is what now uses to put the clippings in.</p>

    <p><q>I have no idea how many nails are in the jar,</q> Gibson admitted. <q>It’s well into the thousands.</q> Even so, his current jar is only 99 percent full, and Gibson says he has no idea what he’s going to do when it’s completely filled. “I’ll probably put them into something else,” he said. <q>I’ve got enough room for several more months worth of nails.</q></p>

    <p>It hasn’t been easy to keep up the collecting – Richard has had to hide the jar from his ex-wife and from visitors for several weeks at a time, but, against all odds, he has kept his menagerie safe and his collection growing.</p>

    By <span class="author">Anne T. Jemima</span></h2>

    <p>You can eat these eight days a week--or after a hard day's night. Artist Nathan Shields sketched the Beatles with pancake batter capturing the process in one rockin' video that recently went viral on YouTube. While Shields posted the video a several months ago, the viral attention continually renews like an influenza virus that keeps mutating.</p>

    <p>Has his choice of medium impacting anything outside of his art? <q>I should have known better,</q> explains Shields. <q>I've ate so many of my trial sketches and carry that weight.</q> But Shields recently swore off consuming his drafts for a serious diet saying, <q>that was yesterday.</q> <q>I'm a loser</q>, he concluded in the end.</p>

<h2 class="title">A chic geek sport emerges for the smart, pudgy, pale, and rich.
By <span class="author">Ivan Youloos</span></h2>

<p>What do billionaire geeks do for sport? They play polo. On segways.</p>

<p>Segway polo works a lot like regular polo, except instead of riding horses, the players are on Segways, and instead of evoking glamorous images of a centuries-old aristocratic tradition, the players are on Segways. Billed as the invention that would change the course of mankind when it was unveiled in 2001, the Segway has instead fallen into more of a niche market, used primarily for tour groups and the tech-obsessed. </p>

<p>The sport has begun to take off--or at least roll slowly apparently defying gravity--growing from an eight-team local bay area tournament to a World Cup. The Segway Polo World Cup features nine teams from five countries—Germany, Sweden, the United States, Lebanon, and Barbados. </p>

<p>The winner receives a trophy called the Woz Cup, in honor of the sport's creator, former Apple computer guru Steve Wozniak. <q>I'll be honest, when I saw the Segway was invented I thought, <q>Wow, this will make lazy people lazier,</q></q> admits Jennifer Sandserson, the World Cup coordinator. But she has been won over by the intensive action and abject violence.</p>

    <p>Segway polo players do typically gentlemanly things like <q>wear white pants.</q> But it's also deceptively violent. Ramming is illegal, but nonetheless fairly common, and when it happens it can lead to grisly injuries like compound fractures. A collision in Segway polo is tantamount to a low-speed car crash, with little more than a helmet to protect you. But if Segway Polo has the violence of traditional sports, its appeal is still limited to the select group of people who already own Segways.</p>

<h2 class="title">Man Sees Golfer On Danish, Bets Dough On Him To Win
By <span class="author">Tiger Woods</span></h2>

<p>Success is sweet, but can a sweet predict success? Or will this gambler get his just desserts?</p>

<p>A college lecturer in Andover, United Kingdom, reportedly saw what he believed to be the face of golfer Rory McIlroy on a cheese Danish and bet $1,700 on him to win the Masters. <q>It’s got to be a sign -- Rory’s face on a piece of food from his girlfriend’s home country,</q> Rob Price told British news site The Independent. <q>My mates had a giggle and think I’m mad, but if I pocket [$20,000], I’ll be the one laughing.</q> Prior to the tournement Price tweeted news of his wager and posted a picture of confection.</p>

<p>In the end nothing could be cruller: McIlroy finished eighth at the Masters and Price was toast. His girlfriend ventured there were several things $1,700 might better have been spent on than an ill-considered pastry play.</p>

By <span class="author">Trey Parker</span></h2>

<p>Matt Stoner doesn't say much. But if you can eat it, Matt Stoner can eat more of it.</p>

<p>Matt doesn't give interviews prefering silence to keep his mouth in training for tournement. And, in recent savory competitions, Matt's training regimen has paid off. He has downed five Big Macs in under a minute, inhaled 120 Chicken McNuggets in 90 seconds, and then quaffed a two liter bottle of coke without letting out so much as a burp.</p>

    <p>During this week's <q>Stay Puft Marshmellow Man Match Meet</q> at Mammoth Cave, silent Matt broke his own record scarfing down 200 marshmellow peeps in 2:21 before the atmosphere turned foul. Speed chugging 200 marshmallows includes ingesting a whole lot of air. And, inside a distended body, that gas needs a way to escape. Fast.</p>

<p>Matt won the meet, besting his second place by whopping 17 seconds. But ironically Matt, who had been hoping to finish the peep show without making one, was anything but silent throughout the awards ceremony.</p>

<h2 class="title">Wearable Futons: Clothing Of The Future?
By <span class="author">Wendy Pigsfly</span></h2>

    <p>Japan, the country that gave the world condom cookbooks, burgers that are completely black and men who eat their own genitals in the name of         art is giving the world something almost as weird: suits that double as futon mattresses.</p>

    <p>King Jim, a Japanese company specializing in office equipment and supplies, recently started selling something called the Wearable Futon Air     Mat Set. It's a jumpsuit made of nylon, polyethylene and polyester that can double between as an overcoat and a bed, for those times when you're     not sure where you're going to sleep.</p>

    <p>The product is available in Japan for about $40 from supplier King Jim -- and that includes an air mattress, according to the Daily Mail.         There is no news of a release in other territories yet. So far, reaction in Japan has been mixed, according to RocketNews24.com. Some people         admire the ingenuity of the idea, while others fear it may make it easier for Japanese companies to force employees to pull all-nighters at the       office.</p>

By <span class="author">Natasha Fatale</span></h2>

    <p>A Russian operator of mobile advertising, Superfon, registered a smiley as its trademark. Now the company intends to charge everyone who uses its trademark in its commercial advertising. Many well-known Russian companies have already said that they are not going to pay a ruble for that. The incident marked yet another attempt to claim the rights for the smiley in Russia. Smileys have become extremely popular all over the world for their ability to help people express their simple emotions online. Superfon registered the winking smiley – ;-) - at the Russian Patent Agency (Rospatent), the president of the mobile operator, Oleg Teterin said. Other smileys - :-), ;), :) - are considered similar to the registered winking smiley and thus should not be used in commercial purposes.</p>

    <p>The head of Superfon reminded that smileys were used in Russia on Nestle’s and McDonald’s street billboards. Superforn will be sending written complaints to those who now use the registered trademark of the Russian operator of mobile advertising. <q>If no reaction is going to follow then we will have to sue those companies and claim financial compensation,</q> Oleg Teterin added.</p>

    <p>Legal expert Viktor Naumov said that Rospatent’s decision guaranteed exclusive rights for the use of the smiley to Superfon. He added, <q>Have a nice day.</q></p>

    An iPhone-Shaped Piece of Plastic for Mobile Online Addicts
    By <span class="author">Levon Hold</span></h2>

    <p>If you’re worried about your smartphone addiction, then the new WhyPhone might be just what you need. It’s the perfect mobile placebo – it         looks and feels exactly like an iPhone, but it does nothing. It’s just a piece of plastic that you carry around in your hand to fool yourself.</p>

    <p>With a thin, light and completely wireless design, the WhyPhone acts as a surrogate to any smart mobile device, enabling you to always have a rectangle of smooth, cold plastic to clutch without forgoing any potential engagement with your direct environment.</p>

    <p><q>Phone addiction is real,</q> says developer Ima Luddite. <q>It’s ruining your dates. It’s distracting you at concerts. It’s enabling your drunk texting. It’s clogging up our sidewalks.</q></p>

    <p>The WhyPhone is 5.5 inches high, 2.6 inches wide and 0.29 inches thick, bringing it quite close to the latest iPhone 6. It is shatterproof and waterproof. It offers infinite battery life. And it comes with a license offering free software upgrades for the life of the phone.</p>

    <p>For those interested in WhyPhone, but concerned about no longer being able to take nude selfies, WhyPhone is available with an optional mirror sticker so you can enjoy ‘real-time’ selfies with your friends when they’re standing right behind you.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Rest at Your Own Risk: Moscow Benches to Publicly Display Sitters’ Weight
    By <span class="author">Boris Badenov</span></h2>

    <p>In a bid they say will raise fitness consciousness, Moscow’s city officials are replacing ordinary park benches with high-tech scales. Soon          park visitors sitting and enjoying pastila will be revealing their secrets to the world.</p>

    <p>The change, which will affect the city’s most popular parks, is being sponsored by gyms hoping to attract more weight-obsessed clients. A            similar campaign is already in place at a public bus stop in the Netherlands, where benches are attached to large electronic panels that              display the seated person’s weight in kilograms. The panels also feature nutrition-related information and gym advertisements.</p>

    <p>One of the first parks in Moscow to experience the new technology is Sokolniki Park on the north side. Park Director Andrei Lapshin said that     twenty weighing benches should be in place by the end of the year. Moscow’s media and advertising head Vladimir Chernikov supports this ambitious     project by saying that he’s for <q>everything progressive and interesting that has been approved from above.</q> He stated the high-tech benches     will also be wired with electricity as phone-charging stations, but definitely not miked so authorities can listen in on conversations.</p>

    <p>Local resident Dan Pearce captured the AWOL latrine online, with the caption: <q>Ever see a loo skip too? Me neither.</q> Keanu Reeves has         already optioned the displaced throne's story for the next sequel of Speed.</p>
