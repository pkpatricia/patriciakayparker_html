    <p>Draped in a Union Jack flag, Alan <q>Big Piggy</q> Nash retained his title last weekend as World Toe Wrestling Champion. The Derbyshire             village of Boughringtown in northern England hosted the World Championship of Toe Wrestling last weekend in a competition that drew spectators       of all ages for some serious toe-tussling.</p>

    <p>Toe wrestling traces its roots to 1976 when Staffordshire pub landlord George Burgess sought to find a new sport for Brits to dominate,             according to the Bentley Brook Inn where the championship took place.  <q>I just love the fact that this is the one sport that England always         win at, we get hammered at everything else,</q> Nash said. <q>My technique ... is to hurt the first person that comes into the ring with me:         hurt them bad and terrify everyone else.</q></p>

    <p>There are two participants in each bout. With their feet on a small square ring on the floor, the competitors begin by locking their big toes     together, before battling arm-wrestling style to drive their opponent's foot to the ground. Toe inspections are a must and mixed sex matches are,     of course, not allowed.</p>

    <q>There have been some dirty toed tactics, &lsquo;flicking off&rsquo; is one of them,</q> organiser Edward Allington said. <q>If you know you're going to         lose, if you pull your toe away then it's difficult for the referee to decide if it's accidental or deliberate.</q>

<p>What do billionaire geeks do for sport? They play polo. On segways.</p>

<p>Segway polo works a lot like regular polo, except instead of riding horses, the players are on Segways, and instead of evoking glamorous images of a centuries-old aristocratic tradition, the players are on Segways. Billed as the invention that would change the course of mankind when it was unveiled in 2001, the Segway has instead fallen into more of a niche market, used primarily for tour groups and the tech-obsessed. </p>

<p>The sport has begun to take off--or at least roll slowly apparently defying gravity--growing from an eight-team local bay area tournament to a World Cup. The Segway Polo World Cup features nine teams from five countriesâ€”Germany, Sweden, the United States, Lebanon, and Barbados. </p>

<p>The winner receives a trophy called the Woz Cup, in honor of the sport's creator, former Apple computer guru Steve Wozniak. <q>I'll be honest, when I saw the Segway was invented I thought, <q>Wow, this will make lazy people lazier,</q></q> admits Jennifer Sandserson, the World Cup coordinator. But she has been won over by the intensive action and abject violence.</p> 

    <p>Segway polo players do typically gentlemanly things like <q>wear white pants.</q> But it's also deceptively violent. Ramming is illegal, but nonetheless fairly common, and when it happens it can lead to grisly injuries like compound fractures. A collision in Segway polo is tantamount to a low-speed car crash, with little more than a helmet to protect you. But if Segway Polo has the violence of traditional sports, its appeal is still limited to the select group of people who already own Segways.</p>
